## Setup dummy repos for testing

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **Strongly recommended:** set up a dummy org/repos before attempting this on your production repos.  
That way you can safely experiment, troubleshoot, and mirror your final configuration.

Example setup:
- Org: `<someorg>`
- Repos:
  - `website-files`
  - `someorg.github.io`

Notes:
- For `someorg.github.io`, you may need to create a branch or trigger an action so it ‚Äúwakes up‚Äù. Configure **Pages** under `Settings ‚Üí Pages`.
- `website-files` does *not* need Pages enabled ‚Äî just commit a dummy `dist/index.html` or `README.md` to test file copy and build triggers.
- The goal: confirm files are copied and a build runs, not to build a full site yet.

## Deploy within a single repo

This is the most common scenario. It‚Äôs simple, well supported, and flexible.

Options (from easiest to most customizable):
- **GUI method** ‚Äî Configure under `Settings ‚Üí Pages`. No keys or config files needed.
- **Workflow method** ‚Äî Use a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` with `GITHUB_TOKEN` and one of:
  - Framework-specific actions (e.g. [Astro GitHub Pages](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/github/))
  - [actions/deploy-pages](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-github-pages-site)
  - [peaceiris/actions-gh-pages](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-pages-action)
  - [tschaub/gh-pages](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages?tab=readme-ov-file#github-pages-project-sites) 

## Deploy across repos or servers

Why you might need this:
- Source repo is private (unsupported by official methods on some accounts).
- You want to use `<org>.github.io` but keep your code in a different repo (avoids renaming repos later if you switch to a custom domain).
- You need to push to another server or service.

> [!NOTE]
> Official actions don‚Äôt support this at most account levels.  

Instead, use **SSH authentication** (*not* personal access tokens).

Options (from easiest to hardest):
- [peaceiris/actions-gh-pages](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-pages-action) with SSH keys ‚úÖ (recommended)  
- [tschaub/gh-pages](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages) + [webfactory/ssh-agent](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/webfactory-ssh-agent)  
- [tschaub/gh-pages](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages) + manual SSH config ‚ùå (not recommended, brittle and error-prone)

We haven't researched if/how to do this with Github Apps, but it is not required at this time.

### Generating SSH keys (required)

All cross-repo/server methods require SSH keys.

**Best practices:**
- Generate fresh keys for this purpose only.  
- Do *not* reuse existing SSH keys.  
- Do *not* associate them with your GitHub account.  
- Do *not* use Personal Access Tokens (they expire).  

#### Step 1 ‚Äî Create key pair

No passphrase (GitHub Secrets cannot handle prompts):

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -a 100 -f path/to/keyfile -N "" -C "github-actions"
```

For older servers (not GitHub) that don‚Äôt support Ed25519:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -o -f path/to/keyfile -N "" -C "github-actions"
```

Output:
- Private key: <keyfile>
- Public key: <keyfile>.pub

If the private key contents doesn‚Äôt say `BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY`, back it up and convert:
```bash
ssh-keygen -p -f path/to/your/key -m pem
```

#### Step 2 ‚Äî Add private key as GitHub secret

Environment secrets are safer than repo/org secrets as they be explicitly requested by deploy actions.

In source repo:
1. Go to `Settings ‚Üí Environments ‚Üí github-pages ‚Üí Environment secrets`.
2. Add secret:
    - Name: `ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY`
    - Value: contents of `<keyfile>` (not .pub)
3. Save.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Ensure the file ends with a newline and uses Linux **LF** line endings.

#### Step 3 ‚Äî Add public key as deploy key

In destination repo (if on GitHub):
1. Go to `Settings ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Deploy keys`.
2. Add new key:
    - Value: contents of `<keyfile>.pub`
    - Enable: **Write access**

For non-GitHub servers or services: add the public key to the server‚Äôs SSH access config. We unfortunately can't provide instruction for every service.

‚úÖ At this point you have valid SSH keys, and they are configured. Test them in a dummy environment before production.

### Example: Using peaceiris/actions-gh-pages with SSH (recommended)

Documentation: 
- [peaceiris/actions-gh-pages](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-pages-action) with SSH keys

**Pros:**
- Single action that does everything (checkout ‚Üí commit ‚Üí push)
- GitHub Actions‚Äìnative: built-in support for deploy_key, external_repository, Jekyll toggle, etc.
- Fewer moving parts ‚Üí less chance of config errors
- Great default behavior for common GitHub Pages use cases

**Cons:**
- Opinionated defaults ‚Äî less flexible if you need unusual workflows
- GitHub Actions only (not portable to other CI/CD)

Here‚Äôs an example working `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:
```yml
# Deploy across repos or servers using peaceiris/actions-gh-pages over SSH
# Deploy inspired by Apathetic Tools ¬∑ MIT
# https://github.com/apathetic-tools/snippets/blob/main/docs/github/github-pages-deploy
# See also: https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-pages-action

name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  
  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# Allow this job to clone the repo and create a page deployment
# We only need read because ssh deploy key will have the write at the destination.
# If using `actions/deploy-pages` and `GITHUB_TOKEN`  to deploy to branch on the same repo you need write.
permissions:
  contents: read 
  # pages: write # since we are ssh pushing, don't need this
  # id-token: write # since we are ssh pushing, don't need this

# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
# However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.
concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  # Single deploy job since we're just deploying
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest    
    # If you stored the secret in the environment
    environment: github-pages
    steps:
      - name: Checkout your repository using git
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # - name: Build site
      #   run: pnpm run build
          
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4
        with:
          deploy_key: ${{ secrets.ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY }}
          publish_branch: gh-pages
          publish_dir: ./dist
          enable_jekyll: true # false if using index.html
          external_repository: <user/org>/<deployment repo>
        if: ${{ github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' }} # only deploy if main branch changed
```

In production you will likely want to make a separate build job, then run deploy.

#### Alternative: tschaub/gh-pages + webfactory/ssh-agent

Documentation: 
- [tschaub/gh-pages)](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages?tab=readme-ov-file#github-pages-project-sites)
- [webfactory/ssh-agent](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/webfactory-ssh-agent)


**Pros:**
- CLI tool that can run anywhere (local scripts, other CI/CD, not just GitHub Actions)
- More granular control over deployment flow (what to publish, when, and how)
- Long track record outside of Actions

**Cons:**
- Requires stitching multiple 3rd-party actions together
- More moving parts ‚Üí more opportunities for configuration and debugging headaches
- Steeper learning curve than peaceiris

See our [example working workflow](assets/examples/deploy-tschaub-webfactory.yml).

There is some troubleshooting steps in there to help you as you get things working. You can safely remove them once you have everything working.

#### Alternative: tschaub/gh-pages + manual SSH configuration (Not Recommended)

> [!WARNING]
> We cannot recommend this approach. Use only if you have a very specific reason and are prepared for extensive troubleshooting.

Documentation: 
- [tschaub/gh-pages](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages?tab=readme-ov-file#github-pages-project-sites)
- [Max Schmitt Github Actions SSH Key blog post](https://maxschmitt.me/posts/github-actions-ssh-key) by Max Schmitt

**Pros:**
- Maximum control ‚Äî no reliance on 3rd-party actions to manage SSH
- Does not handoff SSH keys to 3rd party actions or programs
- Useful if you want to understand the internals of how deploys work
- Alternative to *webfactory/ssh-agent*

**Cons:**
- Very brittle and error-prone in GitHub Actions
- Difficult to get SSH agent working reliably (`$SSH_AUTH_SOCK` issues, agent propagation)
- No working example in this guide ‚Äî we couldn‚Äôt get it stable despite extensive attempts

In our attempts, `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK` never propagated correctly. The blog post uses `SSH_AUTH_SOCK: /tmp/ssh_agent.sock` and `ssh-agent -a $SSH_AUTH_SOCK` so you may have more luck going back to that.

Nevertheless, see our [broken example draft workflow](assets/examples/deploy-tschaub-manual.yml) to get you started.

If you figure it out please let us know.

## Troubleshooting

We can‚Äôt offer case-by-case debugging, but:
- Dummy repos are your best friend.
- Errors are usually due to secrets formatting (newlines, LF/CRLF issues) or SSH agent setup.
- Don‚Äôt hesitate to ask a search engine or AI assistant for error-specific troubleshooting.

‚úÖ With this, you can deploy Github Pages from any repo to any repo or server.
