> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Many icons are trademarked or strongly tied to a specific brand, product, or technology. Only use them when representing their intended meaning.

## 💡Why categorize them? What are the alternatives?

The [Astro Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) integration only supports built-in icon types. Its documentation includes a complete [built-in icon reference](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/icons/#all-icons), but with hundreds of icons—many of which cannot be used freely—it can be difficult to find the one you need.

> [!TIP]
> For alternate solutions—supporting any custom SVG icon, icon set, or even UTF-8 Emoji—see our tips after the categorized built-in icons list.

We've organized the Starlight built-in icons into categories for you below.
